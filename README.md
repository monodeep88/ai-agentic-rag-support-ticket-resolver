# Support Ticket Resolver

## Project Overview

Support Ticket Resolver is a complete full-stack AI project for **Agentic RAG** at **Intermediate** difficulty. It includes a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, sample documents, vector search with ChromaDB support, source citations, timeline logs, structured run storage, Docker files, and tests.

{'topic': 'Customer Support', 'description': 'Automate support ticket resolution using AI and machine learning', 'practical_portfolio_value': 'Improved customer satisfaction, reduced resolution time, and increased efficiency'}

Difficulty controls project complexity, architecture depth, AI model selection, and how advanced the generated codebase is.

- Architecture depth: FastAPI + React, ChromaDB vector search, better API structure, basic error handling
- Selected architecture: Support Ticket Resolver
- Template path: templates/agentic-rag/support-ticket-resolver
- Generated stack: FastAPI, React, ChromaDB-ready vector store, SQLAlchemy run logs
- README style: practical local setup with API and UI examples

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- AI/RAG: LangChain-ready prompt layer, ChromaDB vector storage, local deterministic fallback model
- Workflow: Agent pipeline with planner, retrieval, tool, reasoning, and final answer steps
- Frontend: React and Vite
- Database: SQLite by default, PostgreSQL through Docker Compose
- Testing: pytest
- Difficulty: Intermediate

## Generation Method

This project was generated with a template-based architecture engine. AI is used only for the blueprint, domain customization, sample data, prompts, and documentation. The codebase is produced from tested FastAPI/React/Docker templates rather than raw LLM source output.

## Project Type Satisfaction Map

This generated project satisfies **Agentic RAG** through the runtime path below. The implementation is not only a README claim: the files listed after the diagram are generated in the repository and validated before GitHub push.

Runtime proof points:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` renders the user workspace, starter prompts, answer panel, cited sources, and timeline.
- `backend/app/main.py` exposes `POST /api/ask` and returns the final answer, sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- `backend/app/services/pipeline.py` orchestrates the project-type flow: Planner Agent, Retriever Agent, Reasoning Agent, Reviewer Agent.
- `backend/app/services/vector_store.py` loads sample documents and retrieves relevant cited context.
- `backend/app/domain.py` contains the generated topic-specific workflow steps, business rules, tools, persona, and starter questions.
- `backend/app/db.py` stores each run so the generated app behaves like a real workflow tool instead of a static prompt demo.
- `backend/tests/test_project_contract.py` validates the API contract and project-type behavior.

Type-specific behavior:

- Flow style: Planner -> retriever -> reasoning step -> optional tool call -> final answer with sources and timeline.
- Visible output: final answer, cited sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- Validation gate: pytest, frontend build, Docker Compose config, and Docker build before repository upload.

## Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=false
PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The app runs without an OpenAI key by using a deterministic local answer model. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use LangChain with OpenAI. For CrewAI projects, set `USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=true` after installing dependencies to run the live CrewAI Agent/Task/Crew workflow; otherwise the app uses a deterministic CrewAI-shaped fallback.

For Pinecone projects, add `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` to use a live Pinecone index. Without them, the repo still runs using local ChromaDB/local retrieval fallback.

## Installation

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Run With Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\": \"What is the refund policy?\"}"
```

## Example User Question

```text
What should I do if a customer asks for a refund without an order id?
```

## Expected Output

The API returns:

- `answer`: a grounded answer generated from retrieved context
- `sources`: cited document chunks with similarity scores
- `steps`: planner, retriever, reasoning, tool-call, and final-answer timeline logs
- `project_type`: `Agentic RAG`

## How The RAG/Agent Flow Works

Planner -> retriever -> reasoning step -> optional tool call -> final answer with sources and timeline.

## Project Planner Agent Workflow

User -> React Dashboard -> FastAPI -> Project Planner Agent -> Specialist Agents -> Generated Project -> Auto Testing -> GitHub Repository Creation -> Push Code -> Return GitHub URL

- **Architecture Agent**: Define app boundaries, data flow, runtime stack, and integration points. Outputs: Use a cloud-based ticketing system for scalability and reliability; Train the AI model on a large dataset of customer support interactions; Integrate with a knowledge base for accurate and up-to-date information; Implement a chat interface for user-friendly interaction.
- **Backend Agent**: Design FastAPI modules, service contracts, validation, and error handling. Outputs: Ticketing System: Handles ticket submission, routing, and status updates; AI Model: Generates responses to user queries using machine learning algorithms; Knowledge Base: Provides accurate and up-to-date information for AI model training.
- **Frontend Agent**: Design React screens, state flow, controls, and user feedback states. Outputs: Chat Interface: User-friendly interface for interacting with the AI model.
- **Database Agent**: Design persistence models, sample data, indexes, and audit records. Outputs: Run history; Source document metadata; Generated workflow audit records.
- **Testing Agent**: Define contract tests, smoke tests, and generated project validation. Outputs: Unit testing for individual components; Integration testing for end-to-end functionality; UI testing for user interface and experience.
- **DevOps Agent**: Define environment variables, Docker workflow, and repository packaging. Outputs: Docker-ready project; Environment sample file; GitHub repository upload.
- **Reviewer Agent**: Review the generated plan for completeness, security, and portfolio quality. Outputs: User submits ticket; Ticketing System routes to AI Model; AI Model generates response; Response is displayed to user through Chat Interface.

## AI-Customized Domain Workflow

- User submits ticket
- Ticketing System routes to AI Model
- AI Model generates response
- Response is displayed to user through Chat Interface

## Business Rules

- Tickets must be resolved within 24 hours
- AI model responses must be accurate and up-to-date
- User feedback is collected and used to improve AI model performance

1. The backend loads sample documents from `backend/app/data/sample_docs`.
2. Documents are split into chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded and stored in ChromaDB when available, with a local fallback for development.
4. User questions are matched against relevant chunks.
5. Agent-specific steps run: planner, retriever, tool call, reasoning, reviewer, or graph nodes.
6. The final answer is returned with source citations and a timeline.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

## Validation Gates Before GitHub Push

The SaaS validates generated projects before creating and pushing the GitHub repository:

- `pytest`
